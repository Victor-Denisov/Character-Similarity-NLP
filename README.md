# Multi Class Text Classification on Seinfeld Transcripts
*Seinfeld* is a sitcom created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David where the 4 main characters of Elaine, George, Jerry,
and Kramer navigate their lives through various fictious problems. At the time, the show pioneered a notion of being
about "nothing" and purely focused on the trivial happenings of daily life with a comedic outlook.

The show has been studied in many qualitative applications, however this project explores using quantitative
methods to analyze and understand if there are patterns in Jerry and Larry's transcripts of the show. This project
focuses on predicting which main character (elaine, george, jerry, kramer) would say a certain line by using natural 
language processing algorithms such a Naive Bayes and distilBERT.

Overall, Naive Bayes was able to predict 10% than baseline accuracy and distilBERT was able to predict 97% better than
baseline accuracy
